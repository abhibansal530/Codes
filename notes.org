* C++
** STL
*** Priority Queue
In C++ priority queue (heap) orders elements in such a way so that its first
element is always the greatest of the elements it contains (according to some
ordering).

So by default it acts as a "Max heap". To convert it into a "Min heap", we need
an ordering according to which min element is the "greatest". So we use C++'s
=greater<T>= comparator which orders (x, y) s.t. x > y. So by this ordering
min element will be "greatest" (because it'll be last element in our ordering).
Hence it'll be the first element in our queue, thus giving us a min heap.
